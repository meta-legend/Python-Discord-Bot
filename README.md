# Python-Discord-Bot

This is the repository for my simple message & reply discord bot.

Using Discord's Python Wrapper you can create bots in Python.

Also if you want to test this bot you must obtain a discord bot api token and set the value of "TOKEN" in main.py to os.environ("TOKEN") and finally you should create a Replit environment variable with the name "TOKEN" and value of your token. If you are not using Replit to host your bot, you must find a different way to use your token privately in the bot. It's important that your Discord API token remains private and doesn't get released to the outside world.
